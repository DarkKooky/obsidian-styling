# Specifics

### Font
The font styling was left untouched in order for users to select what best suits them but I do recommend using a monospace font, such as Fira Code.

### Keyboard-Only
This theme has been optimised for hotkey-use only and thus the Quick Switcher

and the Command Palette have been tweaked:
