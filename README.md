# Specifics

### Font
The font styling was left untouched in order for users to select what best suits them but I do recommend using a monospace font, such as Fira Code.

### Keyboard-Only
This theme has been optimised for hotkey-use only and thus the [Quick Switcher](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Quick+switcher)
![Example](https://github.com/DarkKooky/obsidian-styling/blob/main/img/Example%20Quick%20Switcher.png)

and the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) have been tweaked:
