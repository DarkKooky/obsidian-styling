A work in progress theme that aims to resemble the Nano text editor. It is intended to be minimalistic and exclusive to dark mode: for the gremlins and other basement dwellers.

# Specifics
### Font
The font styling was left untouched in order for users to select what best suits them but I do recommend using a monospace font.
### Graph
As I've only implemented colouring for edges, the graph is best used with the parameters found in [graph.json](https://github.com/DarkKooky/obsidian-styling/blob/main/graph.json).
